SELF-GUIDED-PROJECT

Used TensorFlow and Sagemaker's TensorFlow Estimator to create, train and deploy a model that can classify images of
dogs and cats from the very popular Oxford IIIT Pet Dataset with a 5-fold validation accuracy of 97%. Transfer learning
(Pre-trained model MobileNetV2) and Data Augmentation techniques have been used for best results.
